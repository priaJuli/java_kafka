# Getting Started

From my prespective, Apache Kafka is good for java programming, 
build server for mini API to the kafka topics and build any microservices 
from other language programming.

But, in order to build program with java, at least you must understand 
several packages from maven/spring java.

## Features

1. Simple Producer & JSON(With API)
2. Simple Consumer & JSON 
3. Build Model for any TOPICS
